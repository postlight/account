You are a publisher on the Internet. You generate {40:posts} posts per day, for a total of {=posts * 365:annual_posts} posts a year. It costs ${1000:post_cost} to make a post, which means you spend ${=annual_posts * post_cost:annual_expenses} per year on content.

Each post gets an average of {50000:views_per_post} readers, and they go on to look at around {3:recirculation} other pages. That yields {=(recirculation + 1) * (views_per_post * posts) * 30:pageviews} page views every 30 days (and as many as {=views_per_post * posts * 30:uniques} unique readers, although let's be honest). Anyone who visits is {3:repeat}% likely to visit again next month.

At a ${0.01-5.00:cpm} CPM (cost per mille), and with {4:placements} ad placements per page, that means you can make ${=((pageviews + (pageviews * (repeat/100)))/1000) * placements * cpm:revenue}/month, or ${=revenue * 12:annual_revenue} a year.

This means that your annual profit is ${=annual_revenue - annual_expenses:profit}.
