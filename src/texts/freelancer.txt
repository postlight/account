:green_book: You are a freelance writer.

You're able to charge ${0.01-3.00:rate} per word.

:money_bag: You get {1-6:assignments} assignments a month, at an average length of {300-3000:words} words.

This means that you make ${=rate * assignments * words:monthly} a month (assuming they pay), or ${=12*monthly:annual} a year, assuming this holds steady and everyone pays.

:money_with_wings: Taxes at {20:average_tax}% will leave you with ${=annual * (1 - average_tax/100):after_taxes}.

If you pay ${2000:rent} a month in rent and ${683:insurance} a month for insurance this leaves you with

${=after_taxes - (rent * 12) - (insurance * 12):profit}
