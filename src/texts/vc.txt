You have a fund with ${20000000-1000000000:cash_out}. You make {0-200:investments} investments of ${=(cash_out / investments):individual_investment} each.

{0-80:failure}% of those investments fail outright. {0-20:success}% achieve significant growth. That means that you lose your shirt on 

{=ceil(investments * (failure/100)):failures} companies,

don't lose money on {=ceil(investments * (100 - failure - success)/100):averages} investments

and achieve breakout growth on {=floor(investments * (success/100)):successes} investments.

When you take an average of the successful ones you find that your investment in only those firms increased in value {1.0-200.0:multiple} times what you invested.

:money_bag: That means you made ${=successes * multiple * individual_investment:cash_in}, and your exit multiple is {=cash_in/cash_out:exit_multiple}x. Good job! (As long as it was way above 1x, better if it's above 5x, otherwise bad job.) :+1: :+1: :+1: :flag-us: :flag-us: :flag-us:
